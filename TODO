Here is a list of items that need to be addressed in FreeType 2:

*  Add synthesized Unicode charmap processing to the CFF driver.

*  Investigate usage of casts and bit width of integer types used.  The idea is
to typedef FT_Fixed, FT_Long, FT_Int, etc... to use the appropriate built in
integer types.  This is so that we may avoid unnecessary explict typecasts and
side affects inherent in implict casts.  This is mostly an issue on platforms
where long integers are 64 bits wide (instead of 32 bits wide).
