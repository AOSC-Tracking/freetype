    * Added submodule - dlg library (https://github.com/nyorain/dlg)
      in src/dlg.
      This library is used as a logger for FreeType.

    * include/freetype/config/ftoption.h: Added macro `FT_LOGGING` 
      to enable/disable logging in FreeType using dlg.
  
    * [builds] unix-cc-in: Added -std=c99, since dlg does not support 
      C standards below c99. 

    * include/freetype/internal/ftdebug.h: Created an environment for dlg 
      support in FreeType.
