Here is a list of items that need to be addressed in FreeType 2:

* Add synthesized Unicode charmap processing to the CFF driver.

* Fix a bug in the TrueType driver: linear horizontal advances of composites
  are not returned properly.

* Fix 64-bit issues (the code compiles and seems to work, but we've not
  make a thorough check so some fonts could still core dump the library !!)
