Here is a list of items that need to be addressed in FreeType 2; they are
not exactly bugs, but should be considered though:

* Implement stem3/counter hints properly in the Postscript hinter.

* Finalize the cache sub-system.  It has been in beta far too long :-)

* The automatic and Postscript hinters have been improved to increase
  the quality of AA text, but Monochrome and LCD hinting still suck.  We
  need to do something about that.
