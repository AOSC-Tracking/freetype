2020-06-27  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (SDF_Iterator_IO): Removed.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (sdf_edge_iterator_func => sdf_edge_get_min_distance
	  sdf_contour_iterator_func => sdf_contour_get_min_distance): Renamed.
	  Manually iterate through the lists instead of `FT_List_Iterate' to
	  avoid io structs and looks a bit cleaner.

2020-06-27  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf] Added basic outline of the functions required to
	generate sdf.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (SDF_Signed_Distance): Added struct which
	  represent a complete signed distance and can be used to
	  get cross, dot, sign etc.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (SDF_Iterator_IO): This struct will be used
	  while `FT_List_Iterate'.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (sdf_generate): Added function which genearte
	  SDF from `SDF_Shape'.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (sdf_edge_iterator_func,
	                   sdf_contour_iterator_func): Added funcions
	  which iterate through contours and edges and return the shortest
	  distance.
	  

2020-06-26  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf] Added `SDF_Raster_Params' struct which extends
	`FT_Raster_Params' and has a few extra fields. This is done
	to pass extra data to the sdf rasterzier which is required
	while rastersizing.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.h (SDF_Raster_Params): Added a struct which
	  extends `FT_Raster_Params' and has the `spread' parameter.
	  Also moved the max, min and default spread values to this
	  header file.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (sdf_raster_render): Added parameter and
	  attribute checking in order to pick errors and return
	  early.

	* src//sdf/ftsdfrend.c (ft_sdf_render): Setup the `SDF_Raster_Params'
	  and pass it to the rasterizer instead of `FT_Raster_Params'.

2020-06-26  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	* include/freetype/ftimage.h (FT_RASTER_FLAG_): Added
	  a new raster flag `FT_RASTER_FLAG_SDF'. The `ftsdf'
	  rasterizer will only render if this flag is set.

	* src/sdf/ftsdfrend.c (ft_sdf_render): Set the `flags' field
	  of `FT_Raster_Params' to `FT_RASTER_FLAG_SDF'.
	  
2020-06-26  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (sdf_shape_dump): Use `FT_TRACEX'
	  instead of `printf'.

2020-06-26  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (sdf_shape_dump): Added function to
	  dump the `SDF_Shape' on the console for debugging.

2020-06-26  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf] Added functions to de-allocate `SDF_' structs.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (SDF_Contour, SDF_Shape): Use `FT_ListRec'
	  instead of `FT_List' to avoid a few extra allocations.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (SDF_Edge, SDF_Contour, SDF_Shape): Added
	  functions to de-allocate these structs and their members.

	* src/sdf/ftsdfrenc.c: Typo.

2020-06-25  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf] Decompose outline and store it in a temporary
	`SDF_Shape' object for easy iteration and pre-computing
	some variables.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (sdf_outline_decompose): Added function
	  to decompost outline and store it in a `SDF_Shape' object.
	  This allows us to pre-compute some variable.

2020-06-25  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf] Added essential enums and structs required.

	* src/freetype/internal/fttrace.h: Remove tabs.

	* src/sdf/ftsdfrend.c (ft_sdf_render): Calculate padding
	  using the `spread'.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (SDF_Edge_Type, SDF_Edge, SDF_Contour,
	  SDF_Shape): Added structures and their initializer
	  functions.

2020-06-23  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf] Added functionality to set and get module properties.
	Also added a `spread' property.

	* src/freetype/internal/fttrace.h: Added sdf module trace
	  define.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (sdf_TRaster => SDF_TRaster): Use capital
	  character for structs.

	* src/sdf/ftsdfrend.h (SDF_Renderer_Module): Added a struct
	  which extends the `FT_RendererRec' and added the `spread'
	  property.

	* src/sdf/ftsdfrend.c: Synchronized the code to use the new
	  `SDF_Renderer_Module' and added functions to get/set the
	  properties.


2020-06-20  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf] Implemented a few functions required by a renderer
	module.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (sdf_TRaster_): Added new structure to hold
	  the memory allocator `FT_Memory'.

	* src/sdf/ftsdf.c (ft_sdf_raster): Implemented a few essential
	  functions required by `FT_Raster'.

	* src/sdf/ftsdfrend.c (ft_sdf_renderer_class): Implemented a few
	  essential functions required by `FT_Renderer'.

	* src/sdf/ftsdfrend.c (ft_sdf_render): Added functionality to
	  compute shift and padding before rendering the outline.

2020-06-19  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	* include/freetype/ftimage.h (FT_Render_Mode_): Added new
	  pixel mode `FT_PIXEL_MODE_GRAY16' which will be used
	  to represent signed values while rendering to SDF bitmap.

2020-06-19  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	* include/freetype/freetype.h (FT_Render_Mode_): Added new
	  rendermode `FT_RENDER_MODE_SDF' which will be used by the
	  `sdf' module to generate signed distance fields from glyph's
	  outline.

	* src/sdf/ftsdfrend.h, src/sdf/module.mk, src/sdf/rules.mk:
	  Add a new line at the end of files.

2020-06-18  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf] Added the structure of a new module to render
	signed distance fields.

	* src/sdf/sdf.c, src/sdf/ftsdfrend.c, src/sdf/ftsdf.c,
	  src/sdf/ftsdfrend.h, src/sdf/ftsdf.h, src/sdf/ftsdferrs.h:
	  Added files required by the `sdf' renderer module and added
	  the basic structure and functions required.

	* src/sdf/rules.mk, src/sdf/module.mk: Added files required to
	  build the `sdf' module using the default build system.

	* CMakeLists.txt (BASE_SRCS): Add `src/sdf/sdf.c' to the variable.

	* include/freetype/config/ftmodule.h: Added `sdf' module 
	  declaration so that the module can be compiled when not compiling
	  with GNU make.

	* modules.cfg (RASTER_MODULES): Include `sdf' module to the default
	  rasterizer module list.

	* include/freetype/ftmoderr.h: sdf module error define
