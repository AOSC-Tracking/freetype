The CVS archive doesn't contain pre-built configuration scripts for
UNIXish platforms.  To generate them call `autogen.sh', which in turn
depends on the following packages:

  automake (1.9.4)
  libtool (1.5.14)
  autoconf (2.59b)

The versions given in parentheses are known to work.

For static builds which don't use platform specific optimizations no
configure script is necessary at all; saying

  make setup ansi
  make

should work on all platforms which have GNU make (or makepp).
