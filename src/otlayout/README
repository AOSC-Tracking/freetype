This directory contains new otlayout, opentype adapter for ftlayout
interface.  Old otlayout is developed by FreeType developers and not
completed yet.  This new otlayout is not completed but works.

New otlayout supports only gsub table. the glyph substitution for 
Japanese vertical layout is tested. gpos table is not supported.
The languages other than Japanese is not tested yet by us.

The files in this directory are come from different places.

1. FreeType1/TrueTypeOpen support (via pango)
2. Pango/opentype
3. developed at RedHat K.K. supported by Information Technology Promotion Agency, Japan.
4. glib/gunicode.h
5. freetype2/otlayout(old otlayout) directory in FreeType CVS repository

The files in 5. are not used in new otlayout.

This new otlayout is experimental in all aspects. 
One of the biggest issue is that the symbols coming from 1. 
and 2. have global scope; you cannot link gtk/pango library
with new otlayout. The symbol may be conflicted.
